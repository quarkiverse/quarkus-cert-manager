= Using Quarkus Cert-Manager

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

:config-file: application.properties
:extension-status: preview

The Quarkus Cert-Manager extension supports generating an X.509 certificate with the help of the Certificate and Issuer CRD resources handled by the https://cert-manager.io/[Cert-Manager]. When these CRD resources are deployed on the cluster, the Cert-Manager will process them to populate a Secret containing for example a: CA certificate, private key, server certificate, or java keystores, etc.

Under the hood, this extension uses https://dekorate.io/[Dekorate] to generate all the Cert-Manager manifests at build time.

== Create a Quarkus application with the Cert-Manager extension

In this example, we'll create a Quarkus application with the Quarkus Cert-Manager and the Quarkus Kubernetes extensions by running the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=certmanager-quickstart \
    -DclassName="org.acme.quickstart.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-reactive,kubernetes,certmanager"
cd certmanager-quickstart
----

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `certmanager` extension to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="certmanager"
----

This command will add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.certmanager</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-certmanager</artifactId>
    <version>{quarkus-certmanager-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Once we add the Quarkus Cert-Manager extension to your project, you can now generate the resources by running the following Maven command:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

And next, we need to provide the certificate configuration. The minimal information that the extension needs is:
* `secretName`: the name of the Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secret] resource that will include the Cert-Manager generated files.
* the Issuer that represents the certificate authority (CA). See all the supported options in <<issuers,the Issuer>> section.

For all the configuration options, please go to <<configuration-reference,the Configuration guide>>.

The minimal configuration can be provided using the properties file and the following keys:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.certificate.secret-name=tls-secret
# The selfSigned issuer:
quarkus.certificate.self-signed.enabled=true
----

This configuration will generate up to two resources under the `target/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml` file that should look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-example
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-example
spec:
  encodeUsagesInRequest: false
  isCA: false
  issuerRef:
    name: kubernetes-example
  secretName: tls-secret
----

The Quarkus Cert-Manager extension will add, part of the Deployment, a volume mounted from the secret that contains the Cert-Manager generated files to allow the application to access them and to configure the HTTPS/TLS endpoint:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-example
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kubernetes-example
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/certs
              name: volume-certs
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: volume-certs
          secret:
            optional: false
            secretName: tls-secret
----

Moreover, the Quarkus Cert-Manager extension will also autoconfigure the application to accept SSL connections. By default, it will autoconfigure only the Ingress/Route resource if exposed, otherwise, it will enable the HTTPS/TLS configuration for the internal communications of the application. This configuration can be controlled using the property `quarkus.certificate.autoconfigure` which values:

* (Default) AUTOMATIC: It will secure Ingress/Route resources if exposed, otherwise the HTTP endpoints.
* NONE: It won't autoconfigure anything.
* ALL: It will secure the HTTP endpoints and also the Ingress/Route resources if exposed.
* HTTPS_ONLY: It will secure only the HTTP endpoints.
* CLUSTER_ONLY: It will secure only the Ingress/Route resources. It will throw an exception if it was not exposed.

For example, if you want to secure both the internal HTTPs connections and the ingress resource by setting the property `quarkus.certificate.autoconfigure=ALL`, it will update the Ingress resource as follows if the property `quarkus.kubernetes.ingress.expose` is true:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  rules:
    ...
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - kubernetes-example.com
        - localhost
      secretName: tls-secret
----

And it will also autoconfigure the HTTP SSL configuration part of the Deployment resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
  name: quarkus-certmanager-integration-tests-certmanager-ssl
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            - name: QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_STORE_FILE_TYPE
              value: PKCS12
            - name: QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  key: password
                  name: pkcs12-pass
            - name: QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_STORE_FILE
              value: /etc/certs/keystore.p12
----

== Securing Resources

When securing your resources, it's important to validate that the requests are coming from known host names. For this purpose, we can use the `dnsNames` property which is part of the certificate configuration. For example, by adding the following `quarkus.certificate.dns-names` property (it's a comma separated list of strings):

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.certificate.dns-names=foo.bar.com
----

The certificate will only allow requests accessing the server host `foo.bar.com`. Remark: If the DNS Host name does not exist, then you will get an error.

Note that the applications in Kubernetes can be publicly exposed using https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Ingress] resources, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-example
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"
        backend:
          service:
            name: kubernetes-example
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - foo.bar.com
      secretName: tls-secret # < cert-manager will store the created certificate in this secret.
----

== Issuers

The `Issuer` is a Kubernetes resource that represents a certificate issuing authority that can generate signed certificates by honoring certificate signing requests. All cert-manager certificates require a referenced issuer to attempt to honor the request.

The supported issuers of this extension are SelfSigned, CA, Vault, and IssuerRef.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only one issuer must be set between `selfSigned`, `ca`, `vault`, and `issuerRef`.
====

=== SelfSigned

Using the https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/[SelfSigned issuer], the certificate will sign itself using the given private key.
To use the SelfSigned issuer, you need to add the following key property:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.certificate.self-signed.enabled=true
----

=== CA

Using the https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/[CA issuer], the certificate and private key are stored inside the cluster as a Kubernetes Secret and will be used to sign incoming certificate requests.
To use the CA issuer, you need to add the following key properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.certificate.ca.secret-name=ca-key-pair
----

When this certificate is installed in the cluster, Cert-Manager will issue the certificate and generate the CA secret resource `ca-key-pair` which the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ca-key-pair
data:
  tls.crt: <auto generated encrypted data>
  tls.key: <auto generated encrypted data>
----

=== Vault

Using the https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/vault/[Vault issuer], the certificate will be issued by the certificate authority https://www.vaultproject.io/[Vault].
To use the Vault issuer, you need the following key properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.certificate.vault.server=https://vault.example.com:8200
quarkus.certificate.vault.path=my_pki_mount/sign/my-role-name
# Any of the auth mechanisms to login into Vault:
## 1.- Via token secret resource reference:
quarkus.certificate.vault.auth-token-secret-ref...
## 2.- Via using Application Role:
quarkus.certificate.vault.auth-app-role...
## 3.- Via using Kubernetes service account:
quarkus.certificate.vault.auth-kubernetes...
----

=== Using a pre-existing issuer

To use a pre-existing issuer type that is separately installed in the cluster, you can use the `issuerRef` type. For example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.certificate.issuer-ref.name=my-issuer
quarkus.certificate.issuer-ref.kind=ClusterIssuer
----

In this example, we are using a https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/[ClusterIssuer] resource that is part of the Cert-Manager API and that should have previously been installed in the cluster.
